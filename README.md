# A/B Testing

-	A/B testing is a method of comparing two versions of a webpage or app against each other to determine which one performs better against a specific objective.

### Nomenclature
1. Test vs Control/Baseline
   - Control Group - group of visitors shown existing version of the web page. 
   - Test Group - group of visitors shown the new version of the web page.
   - Based on how both groups respond, we can determine if new page is better and should be launched.

2. Null & Alternate Hypothesis
- NULL: There is no impact of change OR The new page is no better or worse than the old page.
- ALTERNATIVE: The new page is better than the old page.

3. Metrics
3.1 Binomial/Discrete
   o CTR (Click Through Rate)
   o Conversion Rate
   o Bounce Rate
3.2 Continuous
   o ARPU (Average Revenue Per User)
   o Average Session Duration
   o Average Order Value

- Discrete & continuous metrics require different statistical tests.

4. Statistical Tests

### A/B testing procedure
o	Decide what to test and based on what the objective is.
o	Create one or more variations of original web element. 
o	Split the website traffic randomly between two variations (i.e., we randomly allocate visitors according to some probability), and finally, collect data regarding web page performance (metrics). 
o	After some time, analyze data, pick the variation that performed best, and cancel the one that performed poorly.


### Approach
1. Interpret descriptive statistics
2. Perform Hypothesis Testing
3. Z_test
4. Logistic Regression
